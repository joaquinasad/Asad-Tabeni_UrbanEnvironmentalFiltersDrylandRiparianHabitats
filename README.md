"Urban environmental filters shape plant functional composition and diversity in dryland riparian habitats"

## Contents

- `FD_Indices.R`: Prepares the plant trait data and calculates functional diversity indices and community-weighted means (CWM) for all sampling sites.
- `data_analysis.R`: Performs statistical analysis and generates plots for the main results presented in the paper.
